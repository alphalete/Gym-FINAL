# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"
##
## frontend:

##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

    message: "BACKEND CLIENT EDITING TESTING COMPLETED: ✅ All requested functionality working perfectly. PUT /api/clients/{client_id} supports updating all fields with proper validation and automatic payment date recalculation. GET endpoints return updated data correctly. Date handling works flawlessly. Error handling is proper (404 for invalid IDs, 422 for validation errors). Backend is fully ready to support the frontend EditClientModal functionality. No critical issues found - client editing backend is production-ready."
  - agent: "testing"
    message: "CLIENT CREATION COMPREHENSIVE TESTING COMPLETED: ✅ POST /api/clients - Working perfectly with all membership types (Standard, Premium, Elite, VIP). ✅ GET /api/clients - Newly created clients appear correctly in list. ✅ GET /api/clients/{client_id} - Individual client retrieval works flawlessly. ✅ Date calculations - Next payment date calculated correctly (30 days from start date) for all scenarios including past dates, future dates, and end-of-month dates. ✅ Validation - Required fields (name, email, monthly_fee, start_date) properly validated with 422 errors. ✅ Email validation - Invalid email formats correctly rejected with detailed error messages. ✅ Duplicate email validation - WORKING CORRECTLY - duplicate emails properly rejected with 400 error. ✅ Data persistence - All created clients persist and appear in subsequent GET requests. CONCLUSION: Backend client creation functionality is working excellently. If users report they 'can't add clients', the issue is likely in the frontend form handling or user interface, not the backend API."
