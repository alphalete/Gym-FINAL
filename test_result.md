# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

The bulk payment reminder endpoint was failing due to missing start_date fields in legacy client data. Fixed the validation error by adding proper fallback handling for missing fields. All backend APIs are now working correctly: ✅ API Health Check, ✅ Email Configuration Test, ✅ Individual Payment Reminders, ✅ Bulk Payment Reminders (18/18 clients), ✅ Client Management (GET/POST/GET by ID), ✅ Membership Types Management. The 'Email Service Online Status Detection' task is now fully functional."
  - agent: "main"
    message: "TASK COMPLETION SUMMARY: All 4 reported issues have been successfully resolved: ✅ Client Information Scrolling (fixed PWA CSS structure), ✅ Reports Page (already working, confirmed via screenshot), ✅ Payment Management (fully implemented with statistics and functionality), ✅ Email Online Status (fixed both frontend detection and backend bulk email endpoint). Screenshots confirm all pages are working correctly with proper online status display."
  - agent: "testing"
    message: "EMAIL FUNCTIONALITY RE-VERIFICATION COMPLETE: Conducted comprehensive email testing as requested in review. All email services are working perfectly: ✅ Email Configuration Test (/api/email/test) - PASSED, ✅ Created test client with real email (Michael Thompson) - PASSED, ✅ Individual Payment Reminder - SENT SUCCESSFULLY, ✅ Bulk Payment Reminders - 21/21 clients sent successfully (100% success rate), ✅ Email Error Handling - WORKING. The backend email service is fully functional. The user's reported 'Failed to send email reminder' issue is likely a frontend problem, not a backend issue. All backend email endpoints are working correctly with proper SMTP configuration and error handling."
