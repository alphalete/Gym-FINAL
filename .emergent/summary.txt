The previous AI engineer successfully stabilized and enhanced a gym management PWA. Initially, core issues like email reminder 404s, client data sync problems due to  only reading locally, and hardcoded URLs were resolved. The engineer then systematically addressed user requests, including implementing client editing, updating branding (from gym emoji to wolf, then to a cross logo), adding payment filtering, fixing date calculation inconsistencies, and resolving clients not showing on mobile PWA via service worker updates and a new refresh mechanism. Finally, comprehensive billing period tracking (start/end dates) was integrated and verified. The workflow involved iterative debugging, direct user feedback, and careful PWA cache management.

<product_requirements>
The application, originally a basic web app, evolved into an Android PWA for a gym management system. The primary goal was to enhance a payment reminder system. Key requirements included:
1.  **Email Functionality**: Implement Gmail SMTP for individual and bulk payment reminders with customizable templates and automatic invoice emailing upon payment.
2.  **Client Management**: Enable CRUD operations for client records, including automatic calculation of next payment dates, status management (Active/Inactive), and client editing with editable fields and correct membership types. The system must also display client start and end dates, which automatically adjust upon renewal.
3.  **Membership Management**: Allow editing and dynamic loading of membership types.
4.  **User Interface (UI)**: Develop a mobile-responsive dashboard, client management table, Add Client form, and Email Center. The UI needed branding updates (specifically a black circle with a white cross logo).
5.  **PWA Functionality**: Enable offline capabilities for client/membership data via local storage, with online-only synchronization for email sending. The PWA must be installable, detect online/offline status, and ensure data persistence and synchronization, especially for newly added clients on mobile.
6.  **Payment Filtering**: Implement clickable statistics for Pending and Overdue payments, allowing users to view relevant client information.
7.  **Date Calculation Accuracy**: Ensure all date calculations, especially for payment due dates and billing periods, are correct and consistent across the application, addressing timezone issues.

<pending_tasks>
-   No explicit pending tasks were identified from the last user message, as the AI engineer declared completion of the requested features. The last user request for billing periods was successfully implemented.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer had successfully implemented and verified the start date and end date functionality for client information, which automatically adjusts when a client is renewed. This involved a multi-step process:

1.  **Date Calculation and Storage**:
    *   The  function in  was modified to calculate  and  based on the payment date, extending the  by 30 days. This ensures that when a client makes a payment, their billing period is automatically updated.
    *   The  method in  was updated to calculate and store initial billing period dates for new clients.

2.  **UI Updates for Billing Period Display**:
    *   The client management interface () was updated to display the new Current Period (showing start and end dates) in both the mobile card view and the desktop table view. This involved adding new table headers and data points to client rows.
    *   The Payments component () was also enhanced to show this billing period information, providing a comprehensive view of client payment history and current billing cycles.

3.  **Verification**:
    *   The service worker cache version was incremented to  and the frontend was restarted to ensure the changes were propagated to the PWA.
    *   Screenshots were taken to visually confirm that the Current Period column was present in the Client Management page and that the billing period information was correctly displayed, including the Not set fallback for older clients without this data.
    *   The system now automatically adjusts dates upon renewal and shows clear visual indicators for billing period information.
