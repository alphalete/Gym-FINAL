The AI engineer's work on the Alphalete Club PWA initially focused on transforming it into a robust, offline-first application, resolving critical bugs like CORS and UI refresh issues, and enhancing user experience. A major architectural shift involved implementing a comprehensive repository pattern () for centralized, offline-first CRUD operations with queued synchronization. Development proceeded iteratively, addressing persistent bugs, integrating dynamic data (membership plans), and refining UI aesthetics with Tailwind CSS. Key achievements included fixing the Add/Delete functionality, comprehensive member editing, accurate due date calculations, and consistent GoGym4U theme application. More recently, the engineer resolved a complex data binding bug in the payment and edit modals, redesigned member card buttons for a modern, minimal look, and fixed an Unassigned status display bug caused by field name mismatches. The current task involves implementing an email sending feature with customizable templates for members.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was working on implementing a new feature: adding an email button to member cards and a section in settings to manage email templates.

The user's explicit requirements for this feature are:
1.  **Email Button**: A new button on member cards that allows sending emails.
2.  **Template Selection**: Clicking the email button should display a simple dropdown to select an email template.
3.  **Default Template**: The default template for selection should be a payment reminder.
4.  **Customizable Body**: The email body should be customizable, with automatic insertion of member name and due date.
5.  **Settings Integration**: A dedicated section within the Settings component to manage and customize these email templates.

The AI engineer has already made significant progress on the frontend implementation for this feature, including:
-   Adding the email button to the  component in .
-   Implementing the dropdown functionality for template selection within the .
-   Adding a click-outside handler to close the email dropdown.
-   Creating the structure for the email template management section within the  component (also in ).
-   Adding logic within the  component to load, add, edit, and delete email templates.
-   The very last action in the trajectory was inspecting the existing  and  to add the necessary backend endpoint for sending emails, as the frontend changes will require a corresponding API to interact with. This indicates the work is shifting towards the backend component of the new email feature.
