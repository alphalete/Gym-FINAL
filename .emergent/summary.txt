The previous AI engineer significantly enhanced a gym management PWA. Starting with core fixes (email 404s, data sync), the focus shifted to implementing a robust automatic payment reminder system with client-specific settings, necessitating backend scheduler integration (APScheduler) and extensive frontend UI updates. Subsequent work involved meticulous debugging of date/timezone inconsistencies across client and payment displays, ensuring data accuracy and consistency. The final major phase involved a comprehensive modern UI overhaul, including color palettes, typography, and component redesign. This process iteratively addressed user feedback, particularly regarding PWA caching and crucial accessibility issues, culminating in multiple rounds of contrast improvements to ensure text readability across the application. The current state is a fully functional PWA with automated reminders and a modern, accessible UI, with the last task focusing on global contrast fixes.

<product_requirements>
The application, a gym management PWA, aims to enhance its payment reminder system and overall user experience.
1.  **Email Functionality**: Implement automatic payment reminders 3 days before and on the due date via Gmail SMTP. This includes customizable templates (defaulting to a professional business template) and automatic invoice emails upon payment.
2.  **Client Management**: Enable full CRUD operations. This includes automatic calculation and dynamic update of  (exactly 30 calendar days from start/last payment), , and . It also requires client editing with editable fields, correct membership types, and a new setting to enable/disable automatic reminders per client.
3.  **User Interface (UI)**: Develop a mobile-responsive dashboard, client management table/cards, Add Client form, Email Center, and a new Auto Reminders dashboard. The UI needs extensive branding updates (cross logo) and a comprehensive modernization, focusing on clean design, improved typography, consistent spacing, and enhanced color contrast for accessibility across all components (navigation, cards, forms, tables, modals).
4.  **PWA Functionality**: Ensure robust offline capabilities for client/membership data via IndexedDB, with online-only synchronization for email sending. The PWA must be installable, detect online/offline status, and ensure data persistence and synchronization, particularly addressing PWA caching issues during updates.
5.  **Payment Filtering**: Implement clickable statistics for Pending and Overdue payments to filter client lists.
6.  **Date Calculation Accuracy**: All date calculations must be precise, consistent across the application, and handle timezone shifts correctly (e.g., ensuring a client start date of the 26th displays as the 26th, not the 25th, on all views).

<pending_tasks>
-   No explicit pending tasks were identified from the last user message, as the AI engineer declared completion of the requested features before the current task of summarizing the trajectory.
-   The last user request (Fix the contrast for custom emails tab and edit client and any other that needs fixing and stop wasting time) is currently being worked on.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was actively working on resolving persistent contrast issues within the application's UI, specifically targeting areas where text readability against grey backgrounds was poor.

The user's explicit request was: Fix the contrast for custom emails tab and edit client and any other that needs fixing and stop wasting time. This is a directive to perform a comprehensive and final round of contrast improvements across *all* remaining problematic UI elements.

The AI engineer's approach involved:
1.  **Aggressive Contrast Improvements**: Deciding to use even darker text colors and bolder fonts to ensure crystal clear readability.
2.  **Targeted Components**: The current focus is on modal components, specifically starting with custom emails tab and edit client modals.
3.  **Code Modifications**:
    *   The previous action () involved applying ultra-high contrast styles to the CSS which likely refers to  to define new, very dark text colors and very bold font weights (e.g.,  for primary text, ).
    *   The last action () indicates the next step is to apply the ultra-contrast classes to all the modal components. This implies modifying JSX in  (or potentially a separate modal component file if one existed, but based on 's size, modals are likely inline) to use the newly defined high-contrast CSS classes.

The work is currently in progress, specifically at the point of applying these aggressive contrast styles to the modals. The goal is to ensure all UI text is perfectly readable, addressing all previously reported and remaining contrast issues.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
Apply ultra-high contrast classes to all remaining modal components (e.g., EditClientModal, CustomEmailModal).
