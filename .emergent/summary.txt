The AI engineer's work started with refining the Alphalete Club PWA, addressing critical bugs in date calculations, and extensively overhauling the UI/UX, particularly for the Dashboard and member management. A significant phase involved implementing and iteratively fixing the email functionality, transitioning from a problematic dropdown menu to a more practical modal approach. This included resolving JavaScript bundling issues, UI overlay problems, and ensuring robust backend API integration.

Most recently, the focus shifted to a major architectural change: migrating the entire application from an Emergent backend to a Google Sheets-based backend using Google Apps Script. This involved creating new API client and sync utilities, updating data repositories to use the new Sheets API, and integrating offline-first capabilities. The final hurdle encountered was a critical bug preventing new members from being created and subsequently deleted, traced back to an incorrect  component being used and issues with its form submission handling, leading to No members found despite user attempts to add them.

<product_requirements>
The Alphalete Club PWA is a mobile-first gym management application focused on client and payment management. Key features include automated 30-day billing, WhatsApp reminders, and an offline-first architecture with full member CRUD operations. The branding was updated to Alphalete Athletics. Recent enhancements focused on improving UI/UX through consistent styling, visibility, and mobile accessibility, specifically for the dashboard, member action menus, and payment history. A major feature was the implementation of email sending with template management and payment receipt options. The core Alphalete Club Payment Logic ensures a fixed 30-day billing cycle. The most recent and critical requirement was to migrate the application from its current Emergent backend to a Google Sheets API, maintaining all offline-first capabilities and the 30-day billing logic client-side. The email functionality was refined from a dropdown to a modal for better usability.

<code_architecture>
The application transitioned from a FastAPI backend with MongoDB to a React frontend that interacts with a Google Apps Script Web App, using Google Sheets as the data store. It maintains robust offline capabilities via IndexedDB.



-   ****: Main React component for routing and PWA initialization. Updated to import and call  on app initialization and  events, ensuring data synchronization with Google Sheets.
-   ****: Contains core UI components like , , , , and .
    -   **Changes**: Email functionality migrated from dropdown to a modal (). Old  states and related logic were removed.  and  were modified to use  via  for CRUD operations. Critical fixes were attempted to correct  submission.
-   ****: Displays KPIs and member lists.
    -   **Changes**: Email functionality migrated from dropdown to a modal. Old  states and related logic were removed, and the  was integrated. All backend API calls for email, status toggling, and member deletion were replaced with  calls via .
-   ****: Repository for member data operations.
    -   **Changes**: Heavily modified to replace all direct backend  calls with , , , and . The  function was refactored to correctly handle both creation and updates using the Sheets API.
-   ****: Environment variables.
    -   **Changes**:  was modified to point to the current preview URL and will eventually be replaced by  and  (though the latter were not explicitly added to this file during the migration step, they were specified for the user to add).
-   ** (NEW)**: Provides a wrapper for interacting with the Google Apps Script Web App (Google Sheets API). It defines  and  for POST/GET operations for members and payments.
-   ** (NEW)**: Handles synchronization between IndexedDB (local) and Google Sheets (remote). It pushes pending local changes and pulls recent remote updates.
-   ** (NEW)**: Contains the  pure function for client-side 30-day billing logic.
-   ****: Settings page component.
    -   **Changes**: Modified to display read-only Google Sheets API URL (masked) and API Key, and includes a Sync now button to trigger .
-   ****: Original FastAPI backend. This backend is now obsolete as the application has migrated away from it.

<pending_tasks>
-   **Member Creation/Deletion Fix**: The primary pending task is to resolve the issue preventing new members from being created and subsequently deleted. This is currently blocked by an identified problem with multiple  components in  and the form's submission handler not being triggered correctly.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary request, the AI engineer was deep into debugging why new members could not be created or deleted after the migration to the Google Sheets backend. The  query from the user (Chat Message 307) initiated this investigation.

Initial tests (Chat Message 310) revealed that no members were being saved locally, thus no members existed to delete. The investigation focused on the  component within .

The AI engineer found:
1.  ** function issue**: The  component's  function (line 1109) was calling , but the  had evolved during migration, requiring  or  based on ID presence. A fix was applied to  to correctly handle both create and update operations (Chat Message 333).
2.  **AddMemberForm Submission Issue**: Despite fixing , member creation remained broken. Debugging logs showed that the  function within  was *never being called* upon form submission (Chat Message 414).
3.  **HTML5 Validation**: Initial suspicion was on silent HTML5  attributes blocking submission if fields were empty. However, even with all fields correctly filled, the  handler was still not triggering (Chat Message 422).
4.  **Multiple  components**: A critical discovery was made (Chat Message 428) that there are **two distinct  components** in . The simpler one, which is currently being rendered and tested, lacks the proper comprehensive form structure and event handlers that the AI engineer was debugging. This explains why debug logs were not appearing and why member creation was failing.

The current state is that the application is successfully migrated to Google Sheets (functionally, from an architecture perspective), but the core member creation functionality is broken because the wrong form component is active/being used, and its submission logic is flawed.
