The previous AI engineer successfully brought the Alphalete Club gym management PWA from MVP, implementing crucial features like client CRUD, payment tracking, and email reminders. The development process was highly iterative, marked by persistent bug fixing related to date calculations, revenue inaccuracies, and UI inconsistencies. A significant effort was directed towards a complete UI overhaul to match the GoGym4U design.

Towards the end of the trajectory, the focus narrowed to resolving critical discrepancies where the user's mobile app displayed incorrect data (e.g., zero members, wrong revenue like TTD 0 or TTD 5000) despite the backend and a debug page showing correct data. The engineer meticulously debugged frontend React components (), PWA service workers (), and local storage interactions. They implemented cascading deletion for clients and aggressive cache-busting strategies (service worker updates, frontend refresh triggers, backend API headers, timestamp-based URLs). A database cleanup was also performed to rule out test data interference. Despite all these measures and successful testing in the environment, the user's *actual mobile device* continues to show incorrect TTD 5000 revenue. The current work involves systematically searching for any lingering hardcoded values or deeper caching issues.

<product_requirements>
The Alphalete Club application is a gym management PWA designed for efficient client and payment handling. Core functionalities include:
1.  **Client Management**: Comprehensive CRUD operations for client data.
2.  **Payment Tracking**: Recording payments, calculating  (30 days from last payment), and automatic invoice emailing.
3.  **Reminders**: Automated payment reminders (3 days before and on due date) via Gmail, with customizable templates and per-client toggling.
4.  **UI/UX Redesign**: Transition to a modern GoGym4U aesthetic, featuring a vibrant, high-contrast design with a dashboard, persistent bottom navigation, client/payment lists with detailed status, and a prominent Floating Action Button. Styling uses teal/blue primary, green/orange accents, rounded corners, and sans-serif fonts.
5.  **Technical**: Robust offline data persistence (IndexedDB), online synchronization, payment filtering by status, and precise timezone-aware date calculations (Atlantic Standard Time - AST).
6.  **New Requirements**: Ability to record payments when adding a new client (even if not paid on joining day, client should show as due or owing with amount), clearer toggle button statuses, and accurate total revenue display on dashboards for both mobile and desktop. The app should function as a complete standalone mobile application without requiring manual cache clearing or debugging. A critical ongoing issue is the persistent display of incorrect data (e.g., 0 members, TTD 5000 revenue) on the user's actual mobile device.

<pending_tasks>
-   Investigate and resolve the persistent discrepancy where the user's *actual mobile device* continues to display incorrect total revenue (TTD 5000) and potentially incorrect member counts (0), despite all implemented cache-busting measures, backend accuracy, and database cleanup. This indicates an extremely stubborn mobile browser cache issue.
-   Systematically check for any hardcoded  or  values remaining in the source code.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was deeply involved in debugging a critical and persistent discrepancy: the user's actual mobile application dashboard still displays TTD 5000 Total Revenue and 0 Active Members, even though the backend API returns TTD 0 revenue and 0 clients (following a comprehensive database cleanup of all test data). This problem persists despite numerous aggressive cache-busting and refresh strategies already implemented.

These past fixes include:
1.  **Correcting **: Ensured it fetches  from .
2.  **Implementing Cascading Deletion**: Modified  to delete payments when a client is removed.
3.  **Extensive Cache-Busting**:
    *   **Service Worker ()**: Updated to  with aggressive  in fetch requests and enhanced update logic.
    *   **Backend ()**: Added , , , and  headers to  and  GET responses.
    *   **Frontend ()**: Appended timestamp-based () and random ID (, ) parameters to API request URLs. Implemented refresh triggers (window focus, periodic 30-second, visibility change) and added a manual ðŸ”„ REFRESH button.
4.  **Database Cleanup**: Systematically deleted 26 test clients and their 5 associated payment records, resulting in a clean database state of 0 clients and TTD 0 revenue.

Despite all these efforts and successful verification in the test environment (which shows TTD 0), the user's specific mobile device continues to display stale data (TTD 5000). The current immediate work involves a systematic search across the codebase for any hardcoded 5000 values that might be bypassing the dynamic data fetching. Initial searches in  yielded no direct matches, indicating the issue is likely a highly persistent mobile browser cache beyond typical web controls.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
Continue investigating the persistent TTD 5000 revenue display on the user's mobile device, focusing on deeper browser or network-level caching mechanisms, given that no hardcoded values were found.
