The AI engineer's work on the Alphalete Club PWA began with critical frontend-backend connectivity debugging, specifically resolving  and service worker issues that caused internet connection errors. This led to a rebuild of the member edit functionality, ensuring consistent UI and robust validation. Subsequently, the focus shifted to refining the application's core logic and user experience. This involved implementing a strict 30-day billing cycle anchored to join dates, complete removal of the PWA service worker to stabilize the Create React App environment, and stringent backend CORS restrictions for security. A major UI overhaul introduced a responsive dashboard with real-time data, summary cards, and color-coding, followed by comprehensive branding with custom Tailwind colors and global UI components. Most recently, a sophisticated settings panel was developed, featuring IndexedDB persistence, a PIN lock for sensitive actions (payments, deletions), and CRUD functionality for membership plans. The ongoing task involves integrating these new settings and plan features into the existing sidebar and adding visual lock badges to protected actions, streamlining the application's functionality and security.

<product_requirements>
The Alphalete Club PWA is a gym management application designed for client and payment handling, emphasizing a mobile-first, robust, and potentially offline-capable experience. Key functionalities include comprehensive client management (add, edit, view), accurate payment processing with invoicing, owed amount display, automated billing cycles, and reliable dashboard statistics (revenue, owed, active members). Initial requirements emphasized offline data sync via a local-first architecture (IndexedDB), standalone mode, no address bar, maskable icons, and WhatsApp reminders.
So far, the application has achieved stable API connectivity by fixing 404 errors and URL override issues. Member edit functionality has been rebuilt with toast notifications. Membership plan management and duplicate type handling are enhanced. Overdue calculations are corrected, and a strict 30-day billing cycle is implemented with payment preview, Zod validation, and a payment history view (with CSV export) backed by an upgraded IndexedDB schema with auditing. The latest updates include a responsive dashboard UI, a comprehensive settings panel with PIN lock, and Membership Plan CRUD, integrated into the app's navigation and protected by PIN.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the previous AI engineer was working on a consolidated set of tasks to enhance the application's core functionality and security. The current focus is on implementing a comprehensive settings panel, robust PIN lock for sensitive actions, and CRUD operations for membership plans.

Specifically, the engineer has:
1.  **Updated frontend dependencies**: Pinned React 18, React Router DOM 6, and other libraries in .
2.  **Cleaned up environment**: Confirmed no  error-hiding flags and no service worker file () or registration code in .
3.  **Refactored settings**: Created  for default settings, and significantly enhanced  to handle persistent storage of settings and new membership plans in IndexedDB (schema version 6).
4.  **Updated billing logic**: Ensured  functions are consistent.
5.  **Enhanced reminders**: Updated  to use a configurable template and date/currency formatting from settings.
6.  **Implemented PIN lock core**: Created  with SHA-256 hashing, PIN prompt UI, and functions to enable/verify PIN.
7.  **Created utility components**: Developed  (a React hook for reactive settings access),  (a visual indicator for PIN-protected actions), and  (a currency formatter).
8.  **Developed new UI tabs**: Created  (a full-featured, collapsible settings panel with instant saving) and  (a UI for creating, editing, and deleting membership plans, with delete operations requiring PIN confirmation).
9.  **Updated routing**: Integrated the new  and  routes into .
10. **Integrated PIN guards**: Applied  to the  and  functions in .

The latest action recorded was successfully adding the routing for  in . The engineer is progressing through a consolidated task list, ensuring all new features are seamlessly integrated and existing functionality remains intact.
