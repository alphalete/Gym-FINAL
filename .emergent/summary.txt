<analysis>
The previous AI engineer's work centered on stabilizing the Alphalete Club PWA, battling persistent frontend-backend connectivity issues, and later, a full rebuild of the member edit functionality. Initial debugging focused on  misconfigurations and  inconsistencies. A significant breakthrough identified the service worker as interfering with API calls, leading to internet connection errors, which was resolved by robust URL handling and service worker adjustments. Post-connectivity fixes, the user requested a complete rebuild of the member edit modal. This involved comprehensive refactoring, integration of toast notifications, and rigorous styling to match the application's evolving design system. Despite numerous iterations and reported fixes, the user continued to report UI discrepancies, notably cut-off buttons and readability issues, indicating a persistent challenge in visual fidelity and responsiveness across deployments.

<product_requirements>
The Alphalete Club PWA is a gym management application for client and payment handling, aiming for a robust, mobile-first experience with offline capabilities. Key features include comprehensive client management (add, edit, view), accurate payment processing with invoicing and owed amount display, automated billing cycles, and reliable dashboard statistics (revenue, owed, active members). The PWA requires strong offline data synchronization via a local-first architecture (IndexedDB), standalone mode, no address bar, maskable/adaptive icons, and WhatsApp reminders. Critical bug fixes included 404 API errors, late fee persistence, notification toggles, and URL override issues affecting core functions and data loading. The implementation has so far addressed core API connectivity, rebuilt the member edit functionality, and refined its styling.

- **frontend/src/App.js**: Main React component managing UI, state, and API interaction.
    - **Changes**: Integrated  modal; removed hardcoded URL overrides; implemented  state and .  modified for  data parsing.  calls replaced with  hook. Dashboard data fetching fixed (). Introduced/refined  helper for consistent URL resolution.  in  ensures  on mount.
    - **Recent Key Changes**: Rebuilt  completely, removing old bugs (alerts, membership type handler), adding modern React patterns, validation, loading states, and change detection. Integrated  prop for feedback. Enhanced  to be more robust, especially for environment variable access. Added  and related functions for cache clearing and integrated into . Added notification banner components.
- **frontend/src/LocalStorageManager.js**: Manages local IndexedDB for offline data.

- Investigate and definitively resolve the discrepancy where the agent's diagnostics report the app is fully operational, but the user repeatedly states that the Buttons at bottom are partially cut off in the Edit Member modal.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the previous AI engineer was addressing a persistent UI bug where the buttons at the bottom of the Edit Member modal were reported as partially cut off by the user (Chat 302). This issue has been reported multiple times previously (Chat 248, Chat 263, Chat 284, Chat 293), despite the engineer's previous attempts to fix it and subsequent perfect visual confirmations via screenshots.

The engineer's last action was in response to Chat 302. They acknowledged the user's report (Chat 304) and applied a fix (Chat 305) by modifying the  file. This fix specifically aimed to adjust the modal height and ensure the footer containing the buttons is always fully visible. Following this code change, the frontend service was restarted (Chat 306). The current state is that the code has been updated to address the button cutoff, and the frontend service is running with these changes, awaiting a re-test to verify the resolution.

<optional_next_step>
Test the Edit Member modal to verify that the buttons at the bottom are no longer partially cut off.
