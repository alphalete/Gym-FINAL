The AI engineer's journey on the Alphalete Club PWA involved a series of iterative improvements and bug fixes. Initially, cleanup of temporary debug components and service worker registrations was performed, which uncovered underlying issues with component routing and outdated dashboard implementations. This led to a significant refactoring of the frontend's core structure, including a complete rewrite of  for robust navigation and dynamic dashboard updates. A refactored  with IndexedDB and localStorage fallback was introduced. Subsequently, a critical  runtime error was addressed by properly implementing settings persistence within . The previous phase saw the replacement of placeholder UI components with functional implementations for client, payment, settings, and plans management. The current task is to finalize data handling and component independence for settings and plans.

<product_requirements>
The Alphalete Club PWA is a mobile-first gym management application designed for client and payment operations. Core functionalities include comprehensive client and payment CRUD, automated 30-day billing with configurable grace periods and anchor modes, and WhatsApp reminders. It emphasizes local-first data persistence via IndexedDB, standalone mode, and a robust offline experience.

Current implementations include stable API connectivity, improved member editing, and comprehensive membership plan management. Payment overdue calculations are corrected, billing cycles are strict 30-day, with payment preview. A payment history with CSV export is supported by an upgraded IndexedDB schema. Recently integrated features encompass a responsive dashboard, a settings panel with PIN lock, and Membership Plan CRUD. The system now features configurable default fees, due-soon thresholds, and flexible billing cycle modes, all integrated into the UI and persistent through IndexedDB, focusing on real-time data consistency and reliable navigation.

<code_architecture>
The application uses a full-stack architecture with a FastAPI backend and a React frontend.


-   **frontend/src/App.js**: The main React component, now serving as the central coordinator for global state, robust URL hash-based navigation, and PWA related logic. It was completely rewritten to incorporate an , ensure  on mount, handle global/event-based navigation fallbacks, and manage a minimal bottom navigation bar, simplifying previous complex routing and removing  dependencies.
-   **frontend/src/Components.js**: This file aggregates major UI components. Initially contained , , and . Significant changes involved removing  and associated debug elements, refactoring the  for dynamic data loading and refresh via custom  events, and implementing full , , , and  (Plans) components to interact with the new  API.
-   **frontend/src/storage.js**: Manages all IndexedDB (and  fallback) interactions. This file was entirely replaced with a robust shim. It now includes  for database setup, , , , , , , and . It ensures creation of , , , and  object stores, providing a unified data access layer.
-   **frontend/src/index.js**: The React application's entry point. It contains minimal React 18 mounting logic and includes a temporary (now confirmed clean) service worker unregistration mechanism to prevent caching issues during development.
-   **frontend/public/sw.js**: A newly created file (replacing a previously deleted one) that serves as a simple network-first service worker, mitigating potential caching problems by not hardcoding asset paths.
-   **frontend/public/index.html**: This HTML file contains the root element for the React app and, importantly, a pre-existing loading-screen div that required explicit JavaScript logic in  to be hidden after the application mounted.
-   **frontend/src/settingsStore.js**: (Target for current work) This file is designated for a dedicated settings management store, which is currently undergoing a complete rewrite to correctly persist and retrieve application settings.
-   **frontend/src/PlansTab.jsx**: (Target for current work) This component is responsible for managing membership plans. It is being updated to directly interface with  for all its CRUD operations, decoupling it from the .
-   **frontend/src/SettingsTab.jsx**: (Target for current work) This component manages the application settings UI. It is being updated to utilize the repaired  for loading and saving configurations.
-   **frontend/src/pinlock.js**: (Target for current work) This file is expected to contain helper functions for PIN-based security, which will be verified for correct implementation.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
-   Ensure the  object store exists in 's IndexedDB upgrade logic.
-   Replace the entire  file with a new, correct implementation for managing settings.
-   Modify  to directly use  for all plan-related data operations, removing any dependency on .
-   Update  to read and save settings using the repaired .
-   Verify and ensure that  contains the necessary helper functions.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the previous AI engineer began working on the task: Fix missing/broken functions by repairing settings store and decoupling Plans from it. This task is critical for ensuring proper data handling and modularity within the application's frontend.

The specific objectives of this ongoing task are:
1.  **Updating **: Ensuring that the IndexedDB schema includes a  object store, which is essential for persisting membership plan data independently.
2.  **Replacing **: A complete overhaul of the  file is planned to establish a robust and dedicated module for managing all application settings.
3.  **Refactoring **: Modifying the  component to directly interact with the unified  for managing membership plans (CRUD operations), thereby eliminating its current reliance on the  and ensuring correct data flow.
4.  **Updating **: Adjusting the  component to correctly utilize the newly implemented or repaired  for loading and saving user configurations.
5.  **Verifying **: Confirming that essential PIN-related helper functions within  are properly implemented and exposed for use across the application.

The AI engineer has just initiated this task by examining the  file, specifically looking to implement the required  object store in the IndexedDB upgrade logic.
