The previous AI engineer's work centered on stabilizing the Alphalete Club PWA, battling persistent frontend-backend connectivity issues, and later, a full rebuild of the member edit functionality. Initial debugging focused on  misconfigurations and  inconsistencies. A significant breakthrough identified the service worker as interfering with API calls, leading to internet connection errors, which was resolved by robust URL handling and service worker adjustments. Post-connectivity fixes, the user requested a complete rebuild of the member edit modal. This involved comprehensive refactoring, integration of toast notifications, and rigorous styling to match the application's evolving design system. Despite numerous iterations and reported fixes, the user continued to report UI discrepancies, notably cut-off buttons and readability issues, indicating a persistent challenge in visual fidelity and responsiveness across deployments.

<product_requirements>
The Alphalete Club PWA is a gym management application for client and payment handling, aiming for a robust, mobile-first experience with offline capabilities. Key features include comprehensive client management (add, edit, view), accurate payment processing with invoicing and owed amount display, automated billing cycles, and reliable dashboard statistics (revenue, owed, active members). The PWA requires strong offline data synchronization via a local-first architecture (IndexedDB), standalone mode, no address bar, maskable/adaptive icons, and WhatsApp reminders. Critical bug fixes addressed 404 API errors, late fee persistence, notification toggles, and URL override issues affecting core functions. The implementation so far has stabilized core API connectivity, rebuilt member edit functionality and its styling, enabled membership plan management, fixed duplicate membership type handling, enhanced notifications, corrected overdue figures, and introduced a 30-day strict billing cycle with payment preview, Zod validation, and a payment history view with CSV export, backed by an upgraded IndexedDB schema with auditing.

<code_architecture>
The application consists of a FastAPI backend and a React frontend.



-   **backend/server.py**: Core FastAPI application for API routes and database interactions.
    -   **Changes**:  model updated to include  and timestamp fields; duplicate membership type validation logic enhanced for case-insensitivity and name normalization to prevent conflicts.
-   **frontend/src/App.js**: Main React component managing UI, state, and API interaction.
    -   **Changes**:  updated to correctly use , removing hardcoded preview URLs.  temporarily simplified to bypass  for debugging. , , ,  refactored for consistent fixed header/footer and scrollable content.  success notifications now utilize global toast system via navigation state. Overdue calculations across dashboard components (, , ) were aligned with  logic to ensure consistency by checking .
-   **frontend/src/LocalStorageManager.js**: Manages local IndexedDB for offline data.
    -   **Changes**:  method signature corrected to accept  parameter, and an invalid  property was removed.
-   **frontend/public/sw.js**: Service worker for caching and offline.
    -   **Changes**:  was incremented to ; temporarily modified to disable API interception for debugging purposes. This file is currently targeted for a versioned caching upgrade.
-   **frontend/src/App.css**: Styling for the application.
    -   **Changes**: Extensive modifications for the rebuilt  and other modals, ensuring consistent modern design. Toast notification styling was improved using the  class for better visibility.
-   **frontend/.env**: Stores frontend environment variables.
    -   **Changes**:  value was confirmed and corrected.
-   **frontend/package.json**: Managed dependencies.
    -   **Changes**:  library was added as a new dependency.
-   **frontend/src/Components.js (NEW)**: Centralized component for core business logic, including client management and payments.
    -   **Changes**: Created to encapsulate payment and client-related functions. It includes , , , , , and the  component (modal UI). Implements strict 30-day billing cycle logic, live payment preview, and integrates Zod validation for client and payment forms. Also hosts the new tab navigation for Dashboard and Payments History.
-   **frontend/src/utils/date.js (NEW)**: Provides reusable date manipulation and status computation utilities.
    -   **Changes**: Created to export , , , , and . These functions replace redundant inline date logic throughout the application.
-   **frontend/src/utils/validation.js (NEW)**: Houses Zod schemas for frontend form validation.
    -   **Changes**: Created to export  and  for robust data validation before persistence.
-   **frontend/src/hooks/usePayments.js (NEW)**: Custom React hook for managing payments data from IndexedDB.
    -   **Changes**: Created to fetch, sort, and expose payment records, along with loading state and a reload mechanism for the  component.
-   **frontend/src/components/payments/PaymentsHistory.jsx (NEW)**: Dedicated UI component for displaying payment transaction history.
    -   **Changes**: Created to provide a tabular view of payment records, including total counts and sums, and enables CSV export functionality for financial reporting.
-   **frontend/src/storage.js (NEW - previously implicitly used as )**: Centralized IndexedDB management.
    -   **Changes**: Created as the primary IndexedDB interface. Schema upgraded to version 2, ensuring existence of , , , and a new  object store for logging. Implemented  function to record critical operations like member and payment saves, enhancing data traceability.

<pending_tasks>
-   Upgrade the PWA service worker () to implement a versioned caching strategy, including defining  and , pre-caching app shell assets, deleting old caches, and using stale-while-revalidate for specific requests while using a cache-first approach for others.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the previous AI engineer was addressing the task of improving the PWA service worker. The objective is to enhance the application's caching strategy by modifying the  file. This involves introducing a versioned cache name to manage different cache versions, specifically . The  event listener needs to be updated to pre-cache essential application shell assets such as the root path (), , and . Furthermore, the  event listener will be configured to clean up outdated caches, ensuring that only the current version of the application assets is retained. For  events, a stale-while-revalidate strategy will be applied to critical resources like HTML documents, JavaScript files, and stylesheets, which means the cached version will be served immediately while a network request is made to update the cache. For all other requests, a cache-first strategy will be implemented. The current state is that the engineer has just finished reading the  file and is poised to implement these modifications.
